# project_dfn
Reconstruct discrete fiber network models from 2d microscopy images using image processing, and analyzed their mechanical behaviors through numerical simulation. 

All code are written in MATLAB, and the mechanical simulation is performed in Abaqus. 

Two ReadMe files are included separately in the folders, which will provide more detailed information.
